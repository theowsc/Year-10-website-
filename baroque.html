    <h1>baroque</h1>
    <p>Like the ranaissanse, a lot of art from this time period was religion and royalty focused. another thing that baroque included 
        was more color theory. Art of the baroque period was full of color and contrast. baroque art featured asymetry, movement, drama and 
        political ideas. A huge discovery from the baroque era was modern perspectave. before this time, paintings featured a very liniar 
        perspectave with no depth, like painting a 2D image.
