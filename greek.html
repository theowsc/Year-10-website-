    <h1>Greek and Roman</h1>
    <p>Anciet greece is one of the most recognised empires and proneers of many new theorys, ideas and techniques. The other thing 
       Ancient greece was known for is thier art, famous four their potery, marble sculptures and uique architecture ancient greece 
       made a huge leap in the progression of western art. Although the ancient greeks were considered the greatest of their time 
       they were not the only civilisations creating art like Egyptian, Minoan and Mycenaean civilisation having their own, unique and 
       equally valuable art. Another civilisation that existed in this art period was perhaps one of the most well known ancient 
       civilisations, rome. Also known for their architecture, sculptures but also their profficiencys in paintings, specificaly mythological
       and early versions of realistic paintings.
